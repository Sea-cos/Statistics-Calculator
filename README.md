Statistics Calculator

This project is a JavaScript-based statistics calculator that takes a comma-separated list of numbers as input and calculates the following statistical measures:

* Mean: The average value of the input numbers
* Median: The middle value of the input numbers when sorted in order
* Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the input numbers
* Range: The difference between the largest and smallest input numbers
* Variance: A measure of the spread or dispersion of the input numbers
* Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, which represents the amount of variation in the input numbers
  
The calculator uses a simple and intuitive interface, where the user can input a list of numbers separated by commas and spaces. The calculator then displays the calculated statistical measures in a clear and easy-to-read format.

This project demonstrates a range of JavaScript skills, including:

* Array manipulation and processing
* Mathematical calculations and formulas
* DOM manipulation and event handling
* User input validation and error handling
